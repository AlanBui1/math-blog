<summary> Solution </summary>

$$\text{Fix the first digit to be 1}$$

$$\text{Case 1: Repeated 1s: One of the 3 remaining digits must be 1. There are } C(9, 2) \text{ ways to pick the other two digits and 3! ways to rearrange the digits} $$

$$\implies {9\choose 2} \times 3! = 216 \text{ ways}$$

$\text{Case 2: Not Repeated 1s: None of the remaining digits can be 1. There are P(9, 2) ways to pick the digits}$$

$$\text{ and } \dfrac{3!}{2!} \text{ ways to rearrange the digits}$$

$$\implies 9 \times 8 \times \dfrac{3!}{2!} = 216 \text{ ways}$$

$$\therefore \text{there are } 432 \text{ numbers in total}$$
