## Problem Statement

If $a$ and $b$ are positive integers such that $\dfrac{1}{a} + \dfrac{1}{2a} + \dfrac{1}{3a} = \dfrac{1}{b^2 - 2b}$, then the smallest possible value of $a+b$ is

## Solution

$a$, $b \in \mathbb{N}$

$\dfrac{1}{a} + \dfrac{1}{2a} + \dfrac{1}{3a} = \dfrac{1}{b^2 - 2b}$

$1 + \dfrac{1}{2} + \dfrac{1}{3} = \dfrac{a}{b(b-2)}$

$\dfrac{11}{6} = \dfrac{a}{b(b-2)} \implies 6 \; \| \; b(b-2)$

$min(a + b) \text { is when b is as small as possible} \implies \text { a is as small as possible}$

$min(b) = 6 \implies a = 44 \implies min(a + b) = 50$
