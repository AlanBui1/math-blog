## Problem Statement

An urn contains $4$ green balls and $6$ blue balls. A second urn contains $16$ green balls and $N$ blue balls. A single ball is drawn at random from each urn. The probability that both balls are of the same color is $0.58$. Find $N$.

## Solution

$\text{There are 10 balls in the first urn and 16+N balls in the second urn.}$

$\implies {There are } (10)(16+N) \text{ total possible ways to pick two balls.}$

$\text{Let } W_1 \text{ be the number of ways to pick two green balls}$

$\therefore W_1 = (4)(16) = 64$

$\text{Let } W_2 \text{ be the number of ways to pick two blue balls}$

$\therefore W_2 = (6)(N) = 6N$

$\dfrac{W_1 + W_2}{(10)(16+N)} = 0.58$

$64 + 6N = 92.8 + 5.8N$

$N = 144$
