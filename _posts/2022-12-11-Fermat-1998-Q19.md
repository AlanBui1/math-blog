## Problem Statement
Square $ABCD$ has sides of length 14. A circle is drawn through $A$ and $D$ so that it is tangent to $BC$, as shown. What is the radius of the circle?

## Solution

Label the point the circle is tangent to $BC$ point $E$

Label the point on the circle opposite to point $E$ point $F$

Label the point where $EF$ intersects $AD$ as point $G$

Since $G$ bisects $AD \implies AG = GD = \dfrac{14}{2} = 7$

Let the radius of the circle be $r$ and $FG = x \implies GE = 2r - x$

By intersecting chord theorem, $FG \times GE = AG \times GD$

$x \times 14 = 7 \times 7$

$x = \dfrac{7}{2}$

$2r - x = 14$

$r = \dfrac{14 + \dfrac{7}{2}}{2}$

$r = \dfrac{35}{4}$
