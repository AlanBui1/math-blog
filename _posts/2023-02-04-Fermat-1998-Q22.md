## Problem Statement

[Problem Link](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/past_contests/1998/1998FermatContest.pdf)

There are four unequal, positive integers $a$, $b$, $c$, and $N$ such that $N = 5a + 3b + 5c$. It is also true that $N = 4a + 5b + 4c$ and $N$ is between 131 and 150. What is the value of $a+b+c$?

## Solution

$N = 5a + 3b + 5c \text{ (1)}$

$N = 4a + 5b + 4c \text{ (2)}$

$\text{(1) x 4: } 4N = 20a + 12b + 20c$

$\text{(2) x 5: } 5N = 20a + 25b + 20c$ 

$\implies -N = -13b \implies N = 13b \implies 13 \| N$

$\text{Since } 131 < N < 150 \implies N = 143$

$\text{(1): } 5(a + c) = 143 - 3(11) \implies 5(a + c) = 110$

$\therefore a+c = 22, a+b+c = 33$
