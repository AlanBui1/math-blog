## Problem Statement
The function $f$ has the properties that $f(1) = 6$ and $f(2x + 1) = 3f(x)$ for every integer $x$. What is the value of $f(63)$?

<summary> Solution </summary>

$$f(1) = 6$$

$$f(2x + 1) = 3f(x) \;\;\; \forall \; x \in \mathbb{Z}$$

$$f(63) = f(2(31) + 1) = 3f(31)$$

$$f(31) = f(2(15) + 1) = 3f(15)$$

$$f(15) = f(2(7) + 1) = 3f(7)$$

$$f(7) = f(2(3) + 1) = 3f(3)$$

$$f(3) = f(2(1) + 1) = 3f(1)$$

$$\therefore f(63) = 3^5f(1) = 3^5(6) = 1458$$
