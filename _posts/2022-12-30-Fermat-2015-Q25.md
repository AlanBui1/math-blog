## Problem Statement

There are $F$ fractions $\dfrac{m}{n}$ with the properties:

$m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $m < n$,

$\dfrac{m}{n}$ is in lowest terms,

$n$ is not divisible by the square of any integer larger than 1, and

the shortest sequence of consecutive digits that repeats consecutively and indefinitely in the decimal equivalent of $\dfrac{m}{n}$ has length 6.

(Note: The length of the shortest sequence of consecutive digits that repeats consecutively and indefinitely in 0.12745 = 0.12745745745745 . . . is 3 and the
length of the shortest sequence of consecutive digits that repeats consecutively and indefinitely in 0.5 is 1.)

We define $G = F + p$, where the integer $F$ has $p$ digits. What is the sum of the squares of the digits of $G$?
