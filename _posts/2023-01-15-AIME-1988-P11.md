## Problem Statement

Let $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ be complex numbers. A line $L$ in the complex plane is called a mean line for the points $w_1, w_2, \dots, w_n$ if $L$ contains points (complex numbers) $z_1, z_2, \dots, z_n$ such that\[\sum_{k = 1}^n (z_k - w_k) = 0.\]For the numbers $w_1 = 32 + 170i$, $w_2 = - 7 + 64i$, $w_3 = - 9 + 200i$, $w_4 = 1 + 27i$, and $w_5 = - 14 + 43i$, there is a unique mean line with $y$-intercept 3. Find the slope of this mean line.
