<summary> Solution </summary>

$$\text{Case 1: Number starts with 5}$$

$$\text{There are 5 options for the last digit, a number from {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}}$$

$$\text{There are then P(8, 2) options for the last two digits}$$

$$\therefore 5 \times 8 \times 7 = 280 \text{ possible numbers in this case.}$$

$$\text{Case 2: Number starts with 4}$$

$$\text{There are 4 options for the last digit, a number from {0, 2, 6, 8}}$$

$$\text{There are then P(8, 2) options for the last two digits}$$

$$\therefore 4 \times 8 \times 7 = 224 \text{ possible numbers in this case.}$$

$$\text{Case 3: Number starts with 6}$$

$$\text{There are 4 options for the last digit, a number from {0, 2, 4, 8}}$$

$$\text{There are then P(8, 2) options for the last two digits}$$

$$\therefore 4 \times 8 \times 7 = 224 \text{ possible numbers in this case.}$$

$$\therefore \text{ there are } 280 + 224 + 224 \text{ even integers between 4000 and 7000 that have four different digits.}$$
